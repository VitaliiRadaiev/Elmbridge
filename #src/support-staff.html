                            Elmbridge Mencap has a board of Trustees who have overall legal responsibility for the charity.  Trustees form the Executive Committee who meet once a month (usually Mondays) to conduct the business of the charity.  This will include ensuring that the charity remains within the law, that money is spent wisely and for the benefit of the charity and making decisions in accordance with the charity's aims and objectives.

                                                Are you interested in contributing to making a difference?  Have you a few hours to spare and skills you feel could be useful? You may be just the person we are looking for!

                                            <p>
                                                Due to retirements of longstanding trustees, we are looking for at least two trustees with a business background, who could bring a variety of skills and experience to supplement and complement our current board of Trustees.  You may be required to take the lead on managing a specific project or assisting with a fundraising campaign or researching and drafting grant applications.  Building a network of contacts within the community will also be important. 
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                You will need to have access to a computer and an email address. Meetings take place once a month at Burview Hall based in Walton on Thames, Surrey, however other areas of work e.g., policy drafting/amending, etc could be carried out at home.  All Trustees are expected to help with fundraising activities such as the annual Christmas Fair which take place at the hall and to attend relevant training and meetings/seminars.   You will also be required to be a member of one or more of our sub committees covering such matters as finance, fundraising, communications. These meet as and when the need arises. In addition, you may be asked to attend meetings with outside bodies to represent the charity.
